# Word Search Solver

This web app grabs a default word grid and word list from a file, and offers a form which allows users to enter custom word grids and word lists into the word search solver. The data is then processed and displayed on screen. The JavaScript console contains more detailed information on the matches, including the position and direction of each match.

There are three types of matches: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. Horizontal matches are indicated by a blue border on the bottom of the matched word. Vertical matches are indicated by a white border on the left and right of the matched word. Finally, diagonal matches are indicated by red text.

*Please Note: The Word Search Solver will only accept custom inputs that contain letters (A-Z) and spaces. I have plans to add support for dashes and possibly apostrophes, at a later date.*
